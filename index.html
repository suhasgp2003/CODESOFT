            <h2>A Revolutionary Life</h2>
            <p>Subhash Chandra Bose (1897-1945), affectionately known as "Netaji" (respected leader), was one of India's most prominent freedom fighters and a towering figure in the Indian independence movement. His unwavering dedication to freeing India from British colonial rule led him to adopt more militant approaches than many of his contemporaries.</p>
            
            <p>Born to a wealthy family in Cuttack, Orissa (now Odisha), Bose was brilliant from a young age. After studying at prestigious institutions in India, he went to England to prepare for the Indian Civil Service but resigned his candidacy and returned to India to join the independence movement, responding to the call for young Indians to dedicate themselves to the cause of freedom.</p>
            
            <div class="quote">
                "Give me blood, and I shall give you freedom!"
            </div>
            
            <p>Bose's political career was marked by a fiery brand of nationalism. While he respected Mahatma Gandhi, he disagreed with the principle of non-violence as the sole means to achieve independence. This ideological difference led him to form the Forward Bloc, a left-wing nationalist faction within the Indian National Congress. During World War II, he sought international alliances to challenge British rule, famously escaping house arrest to travel to Nazi Germany and later to Imperial Japan, where he reorganized the Indian National Army (INA) to fight alongside Japanese forces against the British in India.</p>

            <h2>Enduring Legacy</h2>
            <p>Netaji's influence on Indian history extends far beyond his lifetime. His aggressive pursuit of independence instilled a new spirit of militant nationalism that complemented Gandhi's non-violent approach. The famous INA trials of 1945-46 sparked widespread public sympathy and unrest, significantly accelerating the British decision to grant India independence.</p>
            
            <p>His famous call to action—"You give me blood, and I will give you freedom"—continues to resonate with generations of Indians. His vision of an India free from not only colonial rule but also poverty, inequality, and communal divisions remains relevant today.</p>
            
            <p>While controversy surrounds the circumstances of his reported death in a plane crash in Taiwan in 1945, with many theories and investigations continuing to this day, his legacy as one of India's greatest freedom fighters remains undiminished. His life inspires countless Indians to serve their nation with courage, dedication, and selflessness.</p>
            
            <p>In recognition of his contributions, the Indian government has established numerous memorials, named institutions after him, and featured him on postal stamps and currency. His birthday, January 23, is celebrated as "Parakram Divas" (Day of Valor) in India, honoring his indomitable spirit and patriotism.</p>
